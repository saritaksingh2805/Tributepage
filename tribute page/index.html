          <h2>A Man Who Invented Cubism</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Pablo Ruiz Picasso</b> 25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973
             ) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist 
             and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. 
             One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is 
             known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of
              constructed sculpture,[8][9] the co-invention of collage, and 
              for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore.
               Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles
              d'Avignon (1907), and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a 
              dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and 
              Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.

              His unusual adeptness for drawing began to manifest itself early, around the age of 10, when he became his father’s

              From that point his ability to experiment with what he learned and to develop new expressive means
